latin-db-builder
================

A set of scripts to process a dump from Latin Witkionary and build an sqlite
database of Latin vocabulary.

The bulk of the code is written in Haskell, with a few scripts here and there
to help out.

I doubt there's much here that would be reusable.  I took the copy and paste
approach in a few areas because I was more interested in getting at the data
than building a maintainable data pipeline.
